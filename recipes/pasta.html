    <h2 class="header2">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ul">
        <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> Choose large shrimp (31 to 35 shrimp per pound) to get best results for this
            recipe. </li>
        <li><strong>Pasta:</strong>This recipe uses a 16-ounce package of linguine,</li>
        <li><strong>Butter</strong>Use unsalted butter. You can add salt to taste later in the recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil:</strong> The flavor of the olive oil comes through in this recipe, so use
            the best quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Shallots and garlic:</strong> These aromatics add flavor and fragrance to shrimp scampi.</li>
        <li><strong>Lemon juice:</strong> Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for the best flavor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header2">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep ahead:</strong> Have all of your ingredients prepared and ready to cook<br> before heating your
            skillet. You don't want to have to pause to cut, chop, squeeze, <br>or measure right in the middle of a
            fast-moving recipe. <br>If you use fresh shrimp, you can peel and devein the shrimp earlier in the day,<br>
            then
            keep it chilled in the refrigerator until you're ready to get cooking.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Cook the pasta first: </strong>Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before
            <br>cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm<br> it before serving. Time
            your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp <br>immediately after the pasta is drained; you
            don't want the pasta to sit for too long.</li>
    </ol>
